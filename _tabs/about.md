# Welcome to My GitHub 👋

Hi, I’m **Arinjoy**, a Red Team Operator and Offensive Security Researcher with a focus on advanced adversary simulation, malware development, and Active Directory exploitation. I specialize in stealthy attack techniques, initial access vectors, and post-exploitation tactics that challenge even modern EDRs and defensive mechanisms.

## 🛠️ Areas of Expertise

- **Initial Access Payloads**: Expertise in crafting LNKs, malicious docs, ClickOnce payloads, and more.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Skilled in persistence, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
- **Custom Malware Development**: Proficient in creating evasive, fileless malware and reflective loaders.
- **Red & Purple Teaming**: Simulating APT scenarios to test and improve defensive capabilities.
- **Malware Analysis**: Static and dynamic analysis using IDA Pro, x64dbg, Ghidra, REMnux, and custom sandboxing.
- **Threat Research & TTP Emulation**: Deep dives into APT campaigns and MITRE ATT&CK-mapped adversary emulation.
- **Exploit & Tool Development**: C, C++, C#, and Python development for offensive tooling and automation.

## 🧪 Projects & Research

- **PoisonSting**: A Python-based tool for delivering phishing payloads and bypassing AppLocker.
