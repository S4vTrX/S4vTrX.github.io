# Welcome to my GitHub page!

Hi, I'm Arinjoy, a seasoned Red Teamer and Offensive Security Researcher specializing in initial access vectors and advanced post-exploitation techniques. With vast experience in the cybersecurity realm, I'm dedicated to staying ahead of emerging threats and fortifying digital defenses against sophisticated adversaries.

## Expertise

Throughout my career, I've developed expertise in various areas, including:

- **Initial Access Vectors:** Specializing in crafting and exploiting initial access vectors such as LNK files, macros, CHM files, ClickOnce applications, and other techniques to breach target systems.
  
- **Advanced Post-Exploitation:** From Developing and utilizing advanced post-exploitation techniques to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised environments to researching and developing cutting-edge exploitation techniques to bypass modern security controls and penetrate target environments.

- **Malware Development:** Proficient in crafting custom malware and weaponizing payloads to evade detection and infiltrate systems 
  
- **Red Teaming and Offensive Security:** Conducting comprehensive red team assessments to simulate real-world cyberattacks and assess the effectiveness of defensive measures.

## Certifications

I hold certifications including Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP), and Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK), underscoring my commitment to excellence and professionalism in the cybersecurity field.

## Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing

In addition to my technical skills, I'm passionate about collaboration and knowledge sharing within the cybersecurity community. I actively contribute to open-source projects, share insights through blogs and presentations, and mentor aspiring professionals to foster growth and innovation in the industry.
## Current Focus

In my current endeavors, I am focusing on:

- **Active Directory Red Teaming:** I engage in simulating cyberattacks within Active Directory environments, adept at identifying vulnerabilities and crafting effective mitigation strategies.

- **Penetration Testing:** With a wealth of experience, I conduct thorough penetration tests to evaluate the security posture of networks, systems, and applications, providing insightful analysis and recommendations for remediation.

- **Exploit Development:** Skilled in the development of custom exploits targeting vulnerabilities in both software and hardware systems, enabling the demonstration of real-world attack scenarios and leveraging various programming languages for cutting edge offensive tooling and highly  experienced in devising techniques to circumvent security sandboxes and analysis environments, ensuring the stealthy execution of malware and achievement of its objectives.

- **APT Simulation:** Skilled in the emulation of advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios, evaluating an organization's readiness to detect, respond to, and mitigate sophisticated cyberattacks.

- **Assembly Language and Debugging:** Leveraging the power of assembly language and advanced debugging techniques to delve deep into system internals, facilitating thorough research for defensive solutions while crafting potent offensive tools.
